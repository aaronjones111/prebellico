100% Passive Pre-Engagement and Post Compromise Network Reconnaissance Tool

When attacking, auditing or defending modern internal networks, intelligence is everything.  Understanding the environment can be the difference between successfully penetrating or defending the target environment.

While true, obtaining information about the environment in a stealthy manner, when required, can be difficult within a mature environment. Even during overt engagements, obtaining the information you need within a limited time window can be difficult; especially during engagement delays. Further complicating things, when attacking modern networks, often testing scope is based off of poor assumptions about the target environment, often leading to unrealistic scope reductions a real-world attacker would not operate out of. 

Over the years internal audit and testing engagements have been operating on various assumptions within switched networks, often driving engagement execution methods. But what if these assumptions were wrong? What if we could utilize the wasted time, even weeks in advance, between deployment and engagement execution, to take the time to understand the network? As attackers, what if we could leverage the realities of modern networks and the things customers do to ‘prepare’ for an engagement (backups, security scans, etc.) through 100% passive methods, challenging your assumptions about the target network? What if you you could gain a foothold into an organization prior to engagement execution through 100% passive techniques?

Prebellico is great for red teams, penetration testers, auditors, defenders and hunters alike. Prebellico is a 100% passive network reconnaissance tool designed challenge assumptions made about the target environment regardless of the engagement intent by fingerprinting the environment without touching it, providing an organic untainted view of the environment prior to and during engagement execution. It does this by gathering as much information about the target environment prior to and during an engagement without transmission, including what is called reverse port scanning - without transmission. 

Deployment and execution is simple. By default Prebellico will only operate in a 100% passive state while working to ignore traffic generated by the host it is running on, and it uses very few resources. Thus, by design, there is no need to be concerned about it impacting an environment or overusing resources, regardless of the engagement timeline or engagement objective. Simply launch Prebellico as a root user and the information it gathers will be dumped to the screen as well as logged within a specified or default location via a portable log file and database instance. If more specific functionality is desired, simply leverage the various options built into Prebellico.

Want to further understand an environment you don’t yet have access to? Want to know how to better scope your engagement prior to execution? Prebellico has the ability to process a PCAP file with a maximum SNAPLEN of 262144 bytes prior to an engagement or during an engagement. This is useful for things like processing historical data obtained elsewhere or for scope validation purposes prior to engagement kickoff. You can also merge this data during the engagement by copying the database over and specifying the database and log file at launch time, if so desired.

Soon Prebellico will start to track the time between intelligence updates, and if so desired, work to move into a semi-passive mode after a user defined period of lack of intelligence, or after a specific period, leveraging the information it has obtained to further enumerate resources within the environment. Prebellico also has the ability to understand what is permitted within the environment from network egress point. Eventually Prebellico, if told to do so, will leverage this information and establish a C2 connection using observed egress patters to report back to a listener the information it knows about a network.

Prebellico - Because there is no patch for 100% passive reconnaissance.
